# TOP Project #3: Rock-Paper-Scissors 
This project is about creating the classic game, Rock-Paper-Scissors. 

The player has the option to click rock, paper, or scissors. After clicking, the round will be played and the results will be displayed. The first player to 5 wins will win the game and will be announced the winner.  

I was able to practice JavaScript, event handling, and DOM manipulation through this project.
